## Bella Kamont April 16th M4OEP
## Summary
My program is somewhat like the game Flappy Bird. The user is represented as a unicorn who needs to avoid clouds in the sky and spikes on the ground. The player keeps the unicorn in the sky by hitting the space key. Once the user stops hitting the space key, the unicorn will fall. The player can't fall as there is ground beneath them, however, the user will die if they touch the top of the window (This was added after the video).

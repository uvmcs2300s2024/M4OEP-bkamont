## Summary
My program is somewhat like the game Flappy Bird. The user is represented as a unicorn who needs to avoid clouds in the sky and spikes on the ground. The player keeps the unicorn in the sky by hitting the space key. Once the user stops hitting the space key, the unicorn will fall. The player can't fall as there is ground beneath them, however, the user will die if they touch the top of the window (This was added after the video).
## Known bugs
I don't know of any bugs at the time.
## Future Work
I was originally planning to take a different approach to this project. I wanted to make it more similar to a mobile game I used to play called Robot Unicorn Attack. In this game, you would dash over gaps in the ground and need to avoid falling and crashing into the ground above you. You would also collect fairies. If I had more time I think I would alter the project to incorporate these features and have my game be less like Flappy Bird. I would spawn randomized ground and have the player be able to dash as well as jump. Concerning the game I did create, I think I would create better clouds using 8-bit art and stylize the background more. I would also add a replay feature.
## Grade
I think my program utilized the information I have learned to create a solid simple game. I studied the functions in the classes and played with numbers to figure out how to use the stuff I knew to implement things we didn't do in class. I implemented most of the things from this module and  my game is usable and flexible for people to change the speed if they need to. I also put a lot of time into the project, making commits and pushes over a few days. I ended up changing plans a lot along the way which did affect my final project, but I think overall I am pretty happy with it and believe I deserve a satisfactory grade. I have a lot of ideas for future projects coming out of this module and belief I could use this game as a basis for that rendition of Robot Unicorn Attack I plan to make some day.
